                    <h3>Get Your Project Done Quickly &amp; Efficiently with Precast Concrete</h3>
                    <p>Our products arrive at the job site ready to install, which can save weeks on your project
                        timeline. Precast reduces the need for skilled labor on site, decreases the site
                        footprint, reduces construction waste and cuts down on site noise. There is no need to order raw
                        materials such as reinforcing steel and concrete, and no time wasted setting up
                        forms, placing reinforcement, pouring concrete, dodging bad weather or waiting for concrete to
                        cure.</p>

                    <h3>Why Use Precast Concrete?</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is STRONG and increases in strength over time, unlike other materials that can
                            deteriorate
                        </li>
                        <li>It is DURABLE with a service life shown to be more than fifty years</li>
                        <li>It is ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY since it is a "green" product made of natural,
                            environmentally-safe components
                        </li>
                        <li>It is WEATHER RESISTANT making it well-suited for all-weather applications</li>
                        <li>It is FLAME RESISTANT since it is a non-combustible product</li>
                        <li>It is BOUYANCY-RESISTANT making it ideal for below-grade construction, since its specific
                            gravity enables it to resist buoyancy
                        </li>
                        <li>It is WATERTIGHT when coupled with high quality sealants, making it ideal for a wide variety
                            of watertight applications
                        </li>
                        <li>It is UV-NEUTRAL and does not degrade from sunlight exposure</li>
                        <li>Precast concrete is EASY TO INSTALL rapidly and with simple connections, for low
                            susceptibility to damage during backfill
                        </li>
                        <li>It is VIRTUALLY MAINTENANCE FREE - and any maintenance (such as cleaning of septic tanks)
                            does not typically require special equipment
                        </li>
